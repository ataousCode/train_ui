# Train Booking App ðŸš„
If youâ€™ve ever taken the vast train network in China, youâ€™ve probably used an app like this! This project is a clone of one of the most popular train booking apps in China, recreated using Flutter for learning and development purposes.

This clone replicates the core functionality of a typical train booking app, from searching schedules to booking tickets, offering a seamless experience for users.

Features
ðŸš‰ Search Train Schedules: Look up routes and train schedules across Chinaâ€™s extensive train network.
ðŸŽ« Ticket Booking: Book train tickets with an easy-to-use interface.
ðŸ§³ Booking Management: View, manage, and cancel your bookings.
ðŸ”’ User Authentication: Secure login and registration system (planned with Firebase).
Upcoming Features
In the future, I wanna that the app will be integrated with a backend powered by Spring Boot and Spring Security to add features like user authentication and ticket management, ensuring security and data integrity.

Spring Boot: RESTful APIs for data management and communication.
JWT Authentication: Securing API endpoints and user sessions.
Real-Time Updates: Syncing real-time schedule and availability data.
Tech Stack
Frontend:
Flutter: The app is fully built using Flutter for a fast and responsive UI.
Dart: The programming language used in Flutter.
Firebase (Planned): For authentication and real-time data.
Backend (Planned):
Spring Boot: Will handle the backend REST API.
Spring Security: To manage user authentication and security.
JWT: For token-based authentication.
